                From my time working in the Game Development Team at Source Academy to building a module planner with my teammate, every opportunity that I have been given has been an incredible learning experience for me. Each experience has enriched my coding skills through the use of Java, Python, JavaScript, and React, amongst others, strengthened my knowledge of various software designs and architectures, and enhanced my collaboration and communication abilities.
